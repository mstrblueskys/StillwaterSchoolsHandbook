# Student Records | article


The information on this page is a brief summary. For additional guidance, please review Policy 515: Data Privacy Protection and Privacy of Pupil Specific Data Policy
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive federal funds.
FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their child&rsquo;s education records. When a student reaches the age of 18 or attends a post-secondary school or college, the parent&rsquo;s rights transfer to the student and the student is then an &ldquo;eligible student&rdquo; under the law.
This policy provides guidance related to the following areas:
Directory Information
FERPA requires the school district, with certain exceptions, to obtain written consent prior to the disclosure of personally identifiable information from a child&rsquo;s educational records. However, the school may disclose some student information without written consent when the information is designated &ldquo;Directory Information&rdquo; unless they have advised the district to the contrary in accordance with district procedures.
Directory Information can also be disclosed to outside organizations without a parent&rsquo;s/guardian&rsquo;s prior written consent, regardless of the reason for or source of the requested data.
Directory Information Opt-Out
Parents/guardians may refuse to have directory information made public by completing the Directory Information Opt-Out Form (available in PowerSchool) each year.
Families may choose to opt out of the release of directory information (often shared in yearbooks, special events and sports programs, honor rolls, publications, newsletters, etc.) by selecting &quot;NO&quot; on the form indicating they do not agree to the terms of the policy.
Private Data
Under FERPA, parents and eligible students have right to inspect and review the student&rsquo;s education records maintained by the school. Families may also request that a school correct records believed to be inaccurate or misleading.
Complaints concerning alleged failures by the school district to comply with the requirements of FERPA can be filed with the U.S. Department of Education at the following address:

# Attendance | article


The information on this page is a brief summary. For additional guidance, please review Policy 503: Student Attendance.

Procedure for Reporting an Absence
Use PowerSchool (preferred method) to notify the school of absences. Please include the reason for the absence in the comments section.
Need help? Contact the Family Support Help Desk at 651-351-8404 or familyhelp@stillwaterschools.org
Excused Absences
To be considered an excused absence, the student&rsquo;s parent or legal guardian may be asked to verify, in writing, the reason for the student&rsquo;s absence from school. A note from a physician or a licensed mental health professional stating that the student cannot attend school is a valid excuse.
The following reasons are sufficient to constitute excused absences:
Parent verified illness: Up to three consecutive days or eight total per year
Doctor verified illness: Up to three consecutive days or eight total per year
Family emergencies or serious illness in the family: Up to three days per year
Death or funeral in the student&rsquo;s immediate family or of a close friend or relative: Up to four days per year - [Policy 503, pg. 3]
Family vacation with advanced notice: Up to five days per year
A student&rsquo;s condition that required ongoing treatment for any health related issue: Physical or mental health with a note from provider.

Unexcused Absences and Tardiness
All absences and tardies are unexcused by default. Students and families have 48 hours from the time a student returns to school to contact the school or produce a letter, note, or any documentation verifying a valid excuse reason in order to convert an unexcused code to an excused code. In cases of recurring unexcused absences, administration may also request the county attorney to file a petition with the juvenile court, pursuant to Minnesota statutes. Students attending Stillwater Area Public Schools who attain seven or more unexcused absences are considered a habitual truant and may be referred to the county attorney&rsquo;s office.
Students are expected to be in their assigned area at designated times. Failure to do so constitutes tardiness. Students who accumulate multiple unexcused [Policy 503, page 4] tardies will be subject to the discipline rules found within their school handbook.



# Discipline and Code of Conduct | article


The information on this page is a brief summary. For additional guidance, please review Policy 506.
The policy provides examples of areas of unacceptable behavior subject to disciplinary action, as well as outlines the disciplinary actions that may be taken.
See the Unexpected Behaviors Matrix (Administrative Procedures) for details about our responses to behavior.
The purpose of this policy is to help all members of the school community work collaboratively to create a safe, supportive and equitable school climate through the use of positive discipline practices. Effective positive discipline results from an equitable, supportive environment that stresses student self-direction, decision-making and responsibility.
All students have a right to learn and develop in a setting which promotes respect of self, others and property.
Effective positive discipline can only result from an environment which provides options and stresses student self-direction, decision-making, and responsibility.
The consequences for misbehavior are designed to be fair, firm, and consistent for all students in the district. The consequences apply to all students, preschool through grade 12+, regardless of whether the misbehavior took place in school, on district property, in a district vehicle, at a school or district activity, at a school bus stop, or on a pathway to or from school. Consequences also apply to misbehaviors carried out through the use of electronic communication.

# Technology and Internet Access and Acceptable Use | article


The information on this page is a brief summary. For additional guidance, please review Policy 524: Internet and Technology
Acceptable Use and Safety Policy.
Technology and Internet Access and Acceptable Use
The School Board believes that users should have an opportunity to access the Internet to facilitate learning, and for educational and personal growth in the use of technology, resource sharing, information gathering, and communication skills. The use of the District technology system and access to use of the Internet is a privilege, not a right.
Access to District technology systems and to the Internet enables students to explore thousands of libraries, databases, bulletin boards, and other global resources while exchanging messages with people around the world. The District expects that staff blends thoughtful use of the school District technology system and the Internet throughout the curriculum and educates students about appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms, as well as bullying awareness and response.
The value of access to information and interaction on the Internet far outweighs the risk that users may procure material that is inconsistent with the educational goals of the District. Students are expected to use Internet access through the District technology systems to further educational and personal goals consistent with the mission and policies of the District. Uses which might be acceptable on a user&rsquo;s private personal account on another system may not be acceptable on this limited purpose network.
The Acceptable Use Policy sets forth guidelines for student access and use of district electronic technologies.

Outdoor activity is limited to 20 minutes with an AQI of 101-150, and students do not go outside with an AQI of 151 or above.
