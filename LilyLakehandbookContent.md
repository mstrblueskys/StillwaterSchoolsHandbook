# Attendance | article


<p><strong>The information on this page is a brief summary. For additional guidance, please review <a href="https://www.stillwaterschools.org/our-district/school-board/district-policies/individual-policy/~board/school-board-policies/post/503-student-attendance" target="_blank">Policy 503: Student Attendance</a>.</strong></p>
<p><meta charset="utf-8" />Regular school attendance is directly related to success in academic work, benefits students socially, provides opportunities for important communications between teachers and students, and establishes regular habits of dependability.</p>
<h2>Procedure for Reporting an Absence</h2>
<p>Use <a href="https://stillwater.powerschool.com/public/" target="_blank">PowerSchool</a> (preferred method) to notify the school of absences. Please include the reason for the absence in the comments section.<br />
<br />
Need help? Contact the Family Support Help Desk at <a href="tel: 651-351-8404" target="_blank">651-351-8404</a> or <a href="mailto:familyhelp@stillwaterschools.org">familyhelp@stillwaterschools.org</a></p>
<h2>Excused Absences</h2>
<p>To be considered an excused absence, the student&rsquo;s parent or legal guardian may be asked to verify, in writing, the reason for the student&rsquo;s absence from school. A note from a physician or a licensed mental health professional stating that the student cannot attend school is a valid excuse.</p>
<p>The following reasons are sufficient to constitute excused absences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parent verified illness: Up to three consecutive days or eight total per year</li>
<li>Doctor verified illness: Up to three consecutive days or eight total per year</li>
<li>Family emergencies or serious illness in the family: Up to three days per year</li>
<li>Death or funeral in the student&rsquo;s immediate family or of a close friend or relative: Up to four days per year - [Policy 503, pg. 3] </li>
<li>Family vacation with advanced notice: Up to five days per year</li>
<li>A student&rsquo;s condition that required ongoing treatment for any health related issue: Physical or mental health with a note from provider.</li>
<li>Medical, dental, or orthodontic treatment or counseling appointment</li>
<li>Court appearances occasioned by family or personal action</li>
<li>Religious instruction or holiday with advanced notice</li>
<li>Physical emergency conditions such as fire, flood, storm, etc. </li>
<li>Serving a suspension</li>
<li>Active duty in any military branch of the United States</li>
<li>School bus arrived late</li>
</ol>
<h2>Unexcused Absences and Tardiness</h2>
<p>All absences and tardies are unexcused by default. Students and families have 48 hours from the time a student returns to school to contact the school or produce a letter, note, or any documentation verifying a valid excuse reason in order to convert an unexcused code to an excused code. In cases of recurring unexcused absences, administration may also request the county attorney to file a petition with the juvenile court, pursuant to Minnesota statutes. Students attending Stillwater Area Public Schools who attain seven or more unexcused absences are considered a habitual truant and may be referred to the county attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Students are expected to be in their assigned area at designated times. Failure to do so constitutes tardiness. Students who accumulate multiple unexcused [Policy 503, page 4] tardies will be subject to the discipline rules found within their school handbook.
</p>

<p>Stillwater Area Public Schools conducts criminal history background checks for all applicants 18 years of older who receive an offer of employment with the school district. The school district also seeks criminal history background checks for all volunteers and individuals 18 years or older (except enrolled student volunteers under the age of 18) who are offered the opportunity to provide athletic coaching services or other extracurricular academic coaching services to the school district, regardless of whether compensation is paid. These positions include, but are not limited to: All athletic coaches, extracurricular academic coaches, assistants, and advisors. The school district may elect to seek criminal history background checks for other volunteers, independent contractors, and student employees.</p>
<p><span class="fs_style_2"><strong>Background checks are FREE for volunteers. </strong>Employees are charged $15.</span></p>
<p>The background check process can take up to two weeks to complete, so registering early is important to be ready for volunteer opportunities and avoid delays in hiring. Background checks are simple to complete.</p>
<p>School board policy requires that background checks for volunteers be renewed every four years. Contact a school secretary to check when a background check may expire. Volunteers are also asked to sign a release form.</p>
<h4>There are two options to verify identity:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Social security number</strong>: Submit information for a social security background check online or by completing and submitting a paper application. It takes approximately one week to process a social security number.
<ul>
<li><strong>Online</strong>: Complete an <a data-page-name="Background Check" href="/fs/pages/2859">online form</a> to request a secure link. The person-specific link is e-mailed through a secure website to submit a social security number and other information necessary to complete the background check. <em>Employees can also pay the $15 fee for a background check online.</em></li>
<li><strong>Paper application</strong>: Please visit the <a href="https://www.mapquest.com/search/results?slug=%2Fus%2Fmn%2Fstillwater%2F55082-6079%2F1875-greeley-st-s-45.038792,-92.820930&query=1875%20Greeley%20St%20S,%20Stillwater,%20MN%2055082-6079&page=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Central Services Building</a> or a school office to receive a copy of the application. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fingerprinting:</strong> Complete a background check by providing fingerprints instead of a social security number.
<ul>
<li>To setup an appointment to be fingerprinted, please contact the district receptionist at 651-351-8340. <em>The $15 payment for employees is collected at the appointment. </em>It takes approximately one month to process fingerprints.</li>
</ul>

Acceptable Use and Safety Policy</a></cite>.</h4>
<hr />
<h3>Technology and Internet Access and Acceptable Use</h3>
<p>The School Board believes that users should have an opportunity to access the Internet to facilitate learning, and for educational and personal growth in the use of technology, resource sharing, information gathering, and communication skills. The use of the District technology system and access to use of the Internet is a privilege, not a right.</p>
<p>Access to District technology systems and to the Internet enables students to explore thousands of libraries, databases, bulletin boards, and other global resources while exchanging messages with people around the world. The District expects that staff blends thoughtful use of the school District technology system and the Internet throughout the curriculum and educates students about appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms, as well as bullying awareness and response.</p>
<p>The value of access to information and interaction on the Internet far outweighs the risk that users may procure material that is inconsistent with the educational goals of the District. Students are expected to use Internet access through the District technology systems to further educational and personal goals consistent with the mission and policies of the District. Uses which might be acceptable on a user&rsquo;s private personal account on another system may not be acceptable on this limited purpose network.</p>
<p>The Acceptable Use Policy sets forth guidelines for student access and use of district electronic technologies.</p>

For additional guidance, please review <span class="fs_style_4"><a href="https://www.stillwaterschools.org/our-district/school-board/district-policies/individual-policy/~board/school-board-policies/post/609-religion-in-the-schools" target="_blank">Policy 609: Religion In The Schools.</a></span></strong><br />
<br />
It is the policy of I.S.D. 834 to support a climate of academic freedom in which ideas, including those associated with religion, can be discussed in an objective way, for their educational value, with emphasis on their impact on history, literature, art, music, science, ethics and social institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Teaching about religion and beliefs of conscience is a legitimate and appropriate part of a complete academic education at the elementary and secondary levels. However students/parents may choose to not participate for religious reasons, and engage in alternate instruction, without consequence, as per Minnesota Statute 120B.20.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Parents with questions should contact their building administration.</p>



# School Delays, Closure, Early Release | article


<p>Throughout a school year, there may be times when changes must be made to the regular schedule to keep students safe. These adjustments could include a delay, closure, or early release.</p>
<p dir="ltr">School could be canceled or schedules altered if:</p>
<ul>
<li>A building is deemed unsafe (ex. gas leak)</li>
<li>Buses won&rsquo;t start or run dependably</li>
<li>Local road conditions in neighborhoods are dangerous or impassable</li>
<li>Bus riders face dangerous conditions while waiting for the bus</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Families always have the choice to keep their children home if they feel conditions are unsafe. Be sure to contact the school to notify them of the child&#39;s absence should that happen.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Notification</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Should a decision be made that impacts the school day, families receive an automated phone message, email, and text (if opted in) from the district as early as possible. Information is posted on district and school websites and on the district&rsquo;s social media feed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Announcements can also be found on any of the local television stations, including WCCO Channel 4, KSTP Channel 5, FOX Channel 9, and KARE 11. </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Snow Days & E-Learning Days</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Each year, the district has two official &ldquo;Snow Days&rdquo; in which there is no school in-person or online. After that, any weather-related cancellation results in an <a href="https://www.stillwaterschools.org/our-district/handbook/article/~board/district-handbook/post/e-learning-days" target="_blank">E-Learning Day</a>.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Planning for an Emergency</h4>

<p>CAUTION: Written statements on lockers may be deemed as harassment or violation of school rules or law. The student&rsquo;s personal possessions within a school locker may be searched only when administration have reasonable suspicion that the search will uncover evidence of a violation of a law or school rules. Whenever feasible, the student may be present when her/his property or school property which she/her uses is being searched. A general search of school properties, including but not limited to lockers or desks may occur at any time, and items belonging to the school may be seized. Schools may use specially trained dogs to detect and alert officials to the presence of prohibited items and illicit substances in lockers, common areas and/or school parking areas. If a dog alerts to an item in a locker or vehicle it may be searched.</p>
<h3><strong>Search and Seizure</strong></h3>
<p>If the school administration has a reason to believe an illegal act or violation of school rules has been committed, or is about to be committed, they are authorized to search the student and her/ his personal property or any district property used by the student, and seize any item the possession of which is specifically prohibited by law, district policies, or school rules.</p>

# Student Records | article


<p><strong>The information on this page is a brief summary. For additional guidance, please review <a href="https://www.stillwaterschools.org/our-district/school-board/district-policies/individual-policy/~board/school-board-policies/post/151-policy-data-privacy-protection" target="_blank">Policy 515: Data Privacy Protection and Privacy of Pupil Specific Data Policy</a></strong></p>
<p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive federal funds.</p>
<p>FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their child&rsquo;s education records. When a student reaches the age of 18 or attends a post-secondary school or college, the parent&rsquo;s rights transfer to the student and the student is then an &ldquo;eligible student&rdquo; under the law. </p>
<p>This policy provides guidance related to the following areas:</p>
<p><strong>Directory Information</strong></p>
<p>FERPA requires the school district, with certain exceptions, to obtain written consent prior to the disclosure of personally identifiable information from a child&rsquo;s educational records. However, the school may disclose some student information without written consent when the information is designated &ldquo;Directory Information&rdquo; unless they have advised the district to the contrary in accordance with district procedures.</p>
<p>Directory Information can also be disclosed to outside organizations without a parent&rsquo;s/guardian&rsquo;s prior written consent, regardless of the reason for or source of the requested data.</p>
<h4><strong>Directory Information Opt-Out</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Parents/guardians may refuse to have directory information made public by completing the Directory Information Opt-Out Form (available in <a href="https://stillwater.powerschool.com/public/" target="_blank">PowerSchool</a>) each year. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Families may choose to opt out of the release of directory information (often shared in yearbooks, special events and sports programs, honor rolls, publications, newsletters, etc.) by selecting &quot;NO&quot; on the form indicating they do not agree to the terms of the policy.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Private Data</strong></h4>
<p>Under FERPA, parents and eligible students have right to inspect and review the student&rsquo;s education records maintained by the school. Families may also request that a school correct records believed to be inaccurate or misleading.</p>
<p>Complaints concerning alleged failures by the school district to comply with the requirements of FERPA can be filed with the U.S. Department of Education at the following address:</p>
<p>
Family Policy Compliance Office<br />
U.S. Department of Education<br />
400 Maryland Avenue, SW<br />
Washington, DC
20202-4605</p>
<p><strong>Special Education Records</strong></p>
<p>Student special education files are kept and maintained in the school that the student attends. Current individualized education plans (IEPs) and required special education forms are also kept on the District SpEd Forms System (electronic files). Access to individual student data on the SpEd Forms System is reserved for special education staff working with the student and administration. Parents/guardians should contact the student&rsquo;s special education case manager or building principal to access or request a release of information related to the files.</p>
<p>Minnesota Statutes require that school districts retain special education records for five years after graduation. It is recommended that students and/or their parents keep copies of the last two individual educational plans (IEPs) and the most recent three-year assessment. Request for copies or release of information to other agencies can be made with written authorization by the student, if age 18 or older, or the parent/legal guardian.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Occasionally, the school district utilizes surveys to obtain student opinions and information about students. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Some surveys may collect identifiable student information. Other surveys are anonymous and no attempt is made to identify a student participant. There is not a requirement that the student participates in a survey - nor any penalty for a student who opts out of a survey.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Parents/guardians are asked at the beginning of each year to give consent for their children to participate in surveys. Notice to parents is not required for the collection, disclosure, or use of personal information collected from students for the exclusive purpose of developing, evaluating, or providing educational products or services.</p>
<p><strong>Planned surveys include the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Student Sense of Belonging Survey:</strong> Administered to students in grades K-12 annually. Students respond to 7 age-appropriate, research-based statements designed to gauge their connection to school.</li>
