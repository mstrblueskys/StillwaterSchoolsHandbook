[View the handbook here.](https://github.com/mstrblueskys/StillwaterSchoolsHandbook/blob/main/LilyLakehandbookContent.md)

Quick repo to host the scripts and markdown version of the Stillwater handbook for easier reading.

The original format is not great for a dad with ADHD...

If anyone wants to add other schools to the repo, feel free. 

Initially I ran this as two scripts, one to create the CSV so I could review and then one to create the .md file from there. There's a combined script now that it's working that will grab the list and simply create the .md from the site.
